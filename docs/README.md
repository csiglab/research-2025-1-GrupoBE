## Diversificatoin Model

### Principles

- **Start with Related Industries**: Leverage common technologies, markets, and capabilities to maximize knowledge spillovers and reduce risk.
- **Progressively Increase Complexity & Value Added**: Begin with labor-intensive, cash-generating sectors; reinvest profits to enter capital- and tech-intensive industries.
- **Align with National Development Goals**:  Prioritize import substitution ‚Üí employment ‚Üí export orientation ‚Üí technological upgrading ‚Üí strategic autonomy.
- **Promote Environmental Sustainability**: Integrate green technologies and circular economy principles from early stages.
- **Related Industries (High Share Factor of Common Denominators)**: Increasing Complexity and Value Added.

### Diversiation Path

| Stage         | Focus                                  | Industry Examples                                    | Strategic Benefits                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entry**     | Simple, labor-intensive, cash positive | Textiles & Apparel, Food Processing                  | Employment creation, import substitution              |
| **Growth**    | Medium complexity, tech adoption       | Packaging, Agro-inputs, Construction Materials       | Build skills, increase value-added, backward linkages |
| **Expansion** | Capital & knowledge intensive          | Pharma, Renewable Energy, Industrial Tooling         | Technological upgrading, export capability            |
| **Maturity**  | Strategic & high autonomy              | Advanced Materials, Robotics, Digital Infrastructure | National sovereignty, global competitiveness          |

### Industry Inclusion Criteria

To decide if an industry or firm should join the group:

- Mission Alignment: Does it contribute to national development goals (environment, import substitution, export, employment, tech, autonomy)?
- Strategic Fit: Does it share common capabilities, inputs, or markets with existing portfolio firms?
- Financial Viability: Is there a clear path to sustainable profitability or strategic value?
- Scalability: Can it grow domestically and internationally?
- Social Impact: Does it generate employment, skills, or technological spillovers?
